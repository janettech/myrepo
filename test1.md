# Purpose

This document provides a test plan to evaluate the performance of the system using any device.

# Criteria

There are 4 main criteria for this testing, in order of importance, they are:

1. Stability
2. Battery life
3. Accuracy
4. Yield

# Definitions

UE = User Equipment    
PSM = Power Save Mode    
RTTD = Return Time To Device   

A device consists of:

1. Device circuit cards (base board/modem module)
2. Antenna
3. Battery
4. Firmware
5. Device configuration
6. SIM card

# Methodology

Each device (any single configuration of the above items) will be subjected to an independent set of tests, except where the test plan calls for specific modifications to the device configuration parameters.
